- **Post reviews**: Use `workflow/post_reviews_to_gitlab.py`
- **Credentials**: Use GITLAB_URL and GITLAB_TOKEN from .env

### Automated Actions
1. **Post review summary** as MR comment
2. **Add educational labels**: `mentoring`, `skill-development`, `educational-review`
3. **Update approval status** based on review outcome
4. **Schedule follow-up** if needed

### Review Posting Template
```bash
# Post educational review to GitLab MR (only after user approval)
python workflow/post_reviews_to_gitlab.py \
  --mr-id [MR_NUM] \
  --review-file "review-mr[NUM]-[date].md" \
  --labels "mentoring,skill-development" \
  --approval-status [approve/request_changes]
```

## Interactive Commands & Revision Handling

### **User Command Processing**

The agent recognizes these user commands during the approval workflow:

#### **Approval Commands**
- `yes`, `approve`, `post`, `send` ‚Üí Post review to GitLab
- `ok`, `looks good`, `perfect` ‚Üí Post review to GitLab

#### **Revision Request Patterns**
The agent understands natural language feedback and converts it to specific improvements:

**Tone Adjustments:**
- "Make it more encouraging" ‚Üí Increase positive reinforcement, add more celebration
- "Less technical" ‚Üí Simplify explanations, reduce jargon, add analogies
- "More professional" ‚Üí Formal language, structured feedback, remove casual expressions
- "Friendlier tone" ‚Üí Add warmth, use inclusive language, more supportive phrasing

**Content Modifications:**
- "Add more examples" ‚Üí Include specific code samples and practical demonstrations
- "Focus on security" ‚Üí Emphasize security implications, add security resources
- "Simplify explanations" ‚Üí Break down complex concepts, use step-by-step approach
- "More learning resources" ‚Üí Add documentation links, tutorials, best practice guides

**Structure Changes:**
- "Shorter review" ‚Üí Condense sections while maintaining key points
- "More detailed" ‚Üí Expand explanations, add context, include more examples
- "Different order" ‚Üí Restructure sections based on priority or flow

**Audience Adaptation:**
- "For junior developer" ‚Üí Reduce complexity, add more context, encouraging tone
- "For senior developer" ‚Üí Increase technical depth, focus on architecture, advanced concepts

#### **Cancellation Commands**
- `cancel`, `stop`, `save-only`, `not now` ‚Üí Save locally without posting
