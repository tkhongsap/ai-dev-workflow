# PRD-Driven Workflow

This workflow provides a structured, AI-assisted approach to Product Requirements Document (PRD)-driven development. It helps you:
- Create clear PRDs
- Break down PRDs into actionable tasks
- Process and manage task lists for implementation

## Included Guides

- `01-create-prd.md`: Guide to creating a PRD
- `02-generate-tasks.md`: How to generate tasks from a PRD
- `03-process-task-list.md`: Processing and managing the generated task list

Replit-specific versions are also included for users working in the Replit environment:
- `01-create-prd-replit.md`
- `02-generate-tasks-replit.md`
- `03-process-tasks-replit.md`

## Usage

1. Start with `01-create-prd.md` to draft your PRD.
2. Use `02-generate-tasks.md` to break down the PRD into tasks.
3. Follow `03-process-task-list.md` to manage and execute the tasks.

## Goals

- Streamline the transition from requirements to actionable development tasks
- Leverage AI to automate and enhance the workflow
