# Rule: Validate and Measure Refactoring Results

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in validating refactoring outcomes, measuring improvements against baseline metrics, and generating comprehensive reports that demonstrate the value and impact of the refactoring effort.

## Validation & Prerequisites

Before validating refactoring results:

1. **Execution Completion**: Ensure all refactoring tasks have been completed successfully
2. **Baseline Metrics**: Verify baseline measurements are available for comparison
3. **Test Environment**: Confirm test environments are stable and representative
4. **Monitoring Data**: Ensure performance and quality monitoring data is available
5. **Stakeholder Availability**: Confirm key stakeholders are available for validation review
6. **Documentation Readiness**: Verify all refactoring changes are properly documented

## Process

1. **Validate Prerequisites**: Check execution completion, baseline availability, and environment readiness
2. **Collect Baseline Metrics**: Gather pre-refactoring measurements for comparison
3. **Run Comprehensive Validation**: Execute all validation procedures and tests
4. **Measure Improvements**: Compare current state with baseline across all metrics
5. **Assess Business Impact**: Evaluate the effect on development velocity and quality
6. **Stakeholder Review**: Conduct validation review with key stakeholders
7. **Generate Reports**: Create detailed analysis and executive summaries
8. **Plan Follow-up Actions**: Identify remaining issues and next steps
9. **Document Lessons Learned**: Capture insights for future refactoring efforts
